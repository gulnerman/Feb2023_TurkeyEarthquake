This manipulated rescue requests data from Twitter for 06 Feb 2023 Earthquake in Turkey.
This data is retrieved via Twitter API for my personal academic use. 
I used my API credentials with TwitteR library in R by specifying the word "yardÄ±m" (which means rescue in Turkish). 
In order to serve this data as public to help crisis management of this catastrophic disaster, I manipulated data by the following sequence;

remove (URL, whitespaces, rt, @, #, emoticons, mentions etc.),
group by text and cityName,
summarise min date and max date (to show starting/ last time of repetitive tweets),
tweet count (repetitive tweet count).

This data can be use of any humanitarian and academic efforts. Please be considerate while using, give reference to this repo and contact for further information.
